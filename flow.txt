1) Intros
2) Why we are here  
    What is the purpose of the workshop.
    Lets create a project that allows us to touch a button, to take a picture analyze what is in the picture and sends
    that data to the cloud.
    Cofortable walking away understanding the following
        1) Installing Raspian (all the different ways)
        2) Communicating with the Raspberry Pi Headless 
        3) Understanding the GPIO and how to work with them
        4) prototying with breadbords (simple schematics at least )
        5) Communicating with a camera device (raspicam, ffmpeg, etc )
        6) Using SSH and SCP to work with the Pi
        7) Getting Familiar with node, and npm
        8) Having a basis for a cool IoT idea (show them waterrower and Wackcoon) 
        9) Azure Iot Hub and Cognitive Services
        10) All in 65 lines of code.
